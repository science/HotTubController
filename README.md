# Hot Tub Controller

A web-based controller system for custom hot tub automation and monitoring.

## Overview

This project is a modernization of a custom Android Tasker App system, porting it to web standards to create a more accessible and reusable hot tub control system. The goal is to provide a robust, web-based interface for hot tub automation that others can easily adapt and extend.

## Features (In Development)

- **Backend API**: Complete PHP backend with storage system and external API integration âœ…
- **Heating Control**: Intelligent scheduling with temperature monitoring (Phase 1) ðŸš§
- **Web Interface**: React-based dashboard for monitoring and control (Phase 2) ðŸ“…
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile interface for remote control (Phase 3) ðŸ“…
- **Advanced Features**: ML prediction, analytics, notifications (Phase 3) ðŸ“…

## Background

Originally built as a custom Android Tasker application, this project represents a transition to web-based technologies to improve maintainability, accessibility, and community adoption.

## Current Status & Next Steps

### âœ… **Backend Foundation Complete** 
The PHP backend is fully implemented with:
- External API integration (WirelessTag temperature monitoring, IFTTT equipment control)
- Complete storage system with model-persistence layer
- 346+ tests passing with comprehensive safety features
- Authentication, CORS proxy, and API infrastructure

### ðŸš§ **Next: Heating Control APIs (Phase 1)**
The immediate next development phase focuses on implementing the core heating control logic. See [`backend/ROADMAP.md`](./backend/ROADMAP.md) for detailed implementation plans.

### ðŸ“š **Documentation**
- **Backend Setup**: See [`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md) for installation and development
- **API Documentation**: Available in [`backend/docs/`](./backend/docs/) directory
- **Development Roadmap**: Detailed phases in [`backend/ROADMAP.md`](./backend/ROADMAP.md)
