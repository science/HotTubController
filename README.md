# Hot Tub Controller

A comprehensive web-based automation system for intelligent hot tub temperature management and equipment control.

## Overview

This project provides a complete solution for automated hot tub heating with temperature monitoring, intelligent scheduling, and equipment safety controls. Originally developed as a custom Android Tasker application, it has been modernized into a web-based system with a robust PHP backend, planned React frontend, and comprehensive safety features.

- **⏳ Real-time Dashboard**: Temperature monitoring and heating control interface
- **⏳ Mobile-responsive Design**: PWA-ready interface with authentication integration
- **⏳ Historical Analytics**: Data visualization and performance tracking

### 📅 **Phase 3: Advanced Features - PLANNED** 
- Machine learning temperature prediction and optimization
- Push notifications and email alerts
- Native mobile application
- Weather integration and seasonal usage analysis

## Hardware Requirements

### Temperature Monitoring
- **WirelessTag Outdoor Probe**: DS18B20 sensor for accurate water temperature measurement
  - Product: [WirelessTag Outdoor Probe Basic](https://store.wirelesstag.net/products/outdoor-probe-basic)
- **WirelessTag Ethernet Manager**: Bridge device connecting sensors to internet
  - Product: [Ethernet Tag Manager](https://store.wirelesstag.net/products/ethernet-tag-manager)
- **WirelessTag OAuth API Key**: Account authentication for temperature data access

### Equipment Control
- **Smart Relay Controller**: IFTTT-compatible device for pump and heater control
  - Compatible devices: SmartLife or Tuya-based smart switches/relays
  - Example: 4-channel WiFi relay modules with smartphone app integration
- **IFTTT Webhook Integration**: Service connection for remote equipment operation

#### Required IFTTT Webhooks
The system requires four specific IFTTT webhook events to be configured:

1. **`hot-tub-heat-on`** (Required)
   - Triggers heating sequence via SmartLife/Tuya scene
   - Scene should: Turn on pump → wait ~1 minute → turn on heater
   
2. **`hot-tub-heat-off`** (Required) 
   - Triggers heating shutdown via SmartLife/Tuya scene
   - Scene should: Turn off heater → wait ~1.5 minutes → turn off pump

3. **`turn-on-hot-tub-ionizer`** (Optional)
   - Activates water ionization system
   - Can be stubbed to do nothing if ionizer not installed

4. **`turn-off-hot-tub-ionizer`** (Optional)
   - Deactivates water ionization system
   - Can be stubbed to do nothing if ionizer not installed

#### SmartLife/Tuya Scene Configuration
Since IFTTT cannot directly control individual SmartLife/Tuya switches via API, you must create "scenes" in the SmartLife app that IFTTT can trigger:

**Heat On Scene (`hot-tub-heat-on`):**
```
1. Turn ON hot tub water pump
2. Wait 60 seconds (allows water flow to reach full circulation)  
3. Turn ON hot tub heater
```

**Heat Off Scene (`hot-tub-heat-off`):**
```
1. Turn OFF hot tub heater
2. Wait 90 seconds (cooling circulation for heating elements)
3. Turn OFF hot tub water pump  
```

This sequencing protects heating elements by ensuring proper water flow during operation and cooling circulation after shutdown.

### System Integration
The controller manages equipment through carefully sequenced operations:
1. **Heating Start**: Activates pump → waits for circulation → enables heater
2. **Temperature Monitoring**: Continuous sensor readings with intelligent scheduling
3. **Heating Stop**: Disables heater → cooling pump cycle → stops pump
4. **Safety Controls**: Emergency stop capability with complete equipment shutdown

## Quick Start

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
make install     # Install dependencies and create .env
make dev-setup   # Create directories and config files
make test        # Verify installation with full test suite
make serve       # Start development server (localhost:8080)
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install      # Install dependencies (uses Node 22.19.0 via Volta)
npm run dev      # Start development server (localhost:5173)
```

**Node Version Management**: This project uses [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to automatically switch to Node 22.19.0 when working in the frontend directory. Volta is configured in `frontend/package.json` and will automatically download and use the correct Node/npm versions.

### Environment Configuration
1. Configure WirelessTag OAuth token in `.env`
2. Set IFTTT webhook key for equipment control
3. Configure CORS origins for frontend domains
4. Review safety settings and test mode configuration

See [`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md) for detailed installation instructions.

## Documentation

## Safety Considerations

This system controls real hot tub hardware including pumps, heaters, and electrical equipment. Multiple safety layers are implemented:

- **Test Mode Detection**: Automatic safe mode when API keys are missing or invalid
- **Environment Separation**: Dedicated test configuration prevents accidental hardware activation  
- **Emergency Controls**: Immediate stop capability with proper equipment shutdown sequences
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail for all equipment operations
- **Hardware Safety**: Proper sequencing prevents unsafe equipment states

Always use test mode during development and ensure proper safety measures before deployment.
