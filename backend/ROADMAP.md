## 📋 **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Start with Phase 1.1** 👈
The next logical step is implementing the **CronManager system** since:
1. It's required by all heating control APIs
2. It's self-contained and testable
3. It establishes the security foundation for cron-based operations

### **Development Best Practices**
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation for all new APIs
- **Safety-First**: All heating operations must have emergency stop capability
- **Documentation**: Update API docs as endpoints are implemented
- **Code Quality**: Maintain PSR-12 standards and >90% test coverage

### **External Dependencies**
- **WirelessTag API**: OAuth setup guide in `docs/wirelesstag-oauth.md`
- **IFTTT Webhooks**: Event configuration documented in `docs/external-apis.md`
- **Cron System**: Ensure cron service is available and properly configured

---

## 🔄 **Iterative Approach**

Each phase should be:
1. **Fully implemented** with comprehensive tests
2. **Documented** with API specifications and user guides
3. **Deployed** to staging environment for validation
4. **User tested** with real heating scenarios
5. **Production ready** before moving to next phase

This approach ensures each component is solid and reliable before building on top of it.
